This Page tries to explain and show how python packaging and imports are working.

Packaging is for a python beginner a very hard to understand topic and there are many caveats and pseudo solutions a python beginner could struggle with.
The following sections will describe the different tests.

> To avoid issues between the tests, it is a good approach to start a new console for each test.
